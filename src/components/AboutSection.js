                    <h4>CAMPUSES</h4>
                    <p>Certain distinguishing features of Dwarka Campus are State of the Art Buildings:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rain Water Harvesting;</li>
                        <li>Sewage Treatment Plant (Recycling for flushing, air-conditioning & horticulture);</li>
                        <li>Usage of solar energy;</li>
                        <li>Disabled friendly - Vehicular free pedestrian walk ways;</li>
                        <li>Adequate sports facilities;</li>
                        <li>Shopping complex;</li>
                        <li>Innovative landscaping;</li>

                        <li>Murals & Sculptures.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With the commencement of the academic session 2015-16, the University has put a check on its 
                        quantitative growth; the cases of additional intake in existing programme/s and grant of 
                        affiliation to new institutions are examined quite stringently. Even so, it is open to start 
                        new academic programmes in case it is likely to augment the supply of trained manpower for the 
                        so far neglected socio-economic sector(s)/segments of population.
                    </p>
